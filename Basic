React 🛠️
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It's widely used to create fast, interactive web apps.

Key Features ✨
Component-Based Architecture 🧩

React apps are built from reusable components that can be combined like building blocks. Components help manage large applications by breaking them into smaller, independent parts.
Virtual DOM 🖥️

React uses a virtual DOM to optimize performance. Instead of updating the whole page, it only updates the parts that change. ⚡
Declarative UI 🖼️

You tell React what you want the UI to look like at any point, and React handles how to render it. It’s like describing the result, not the process.
JSX Syntax ✏️

React uses JSX, a mix of HTML and JavaScript. It’s easy to write and read, making your code cleaner and more understandable.
Unidirectional Data Flow 🔄

Data flows in one direction, making the state more predictable. Parent components pass data down to child components, simplifying debugging.
